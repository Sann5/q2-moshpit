# Usage tutorial
This is an introductory tutorial to shotgun metagenome analysis using the QIIME 2 MOSHPIT pipeline. 
This tutorial is still **work in progress** and will be updated regularly. It does not cover all aspects of the pipeline, 
but should provide a good starting point for new users. We will not be using any real data in this tutorial, but instead 
will simulate a small dataset based on a set of genomes of known origin.

## Prerequisites
You need the conda environment created according to the instructions available under the [Installation](#installation) section.
